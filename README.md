# 🎨 React Props Flow — Parent → Child → Grandchild

A simple React practice project that demonstrates how data (props) flows through multiple component levels.  
Perfect for understanding **one-way data flow** in React and how components communicate in a clean, modern structure.  

## 🚀 Features
- Parent component sends data to Child  
- Child forwards props to Grandchild  
- Grandchild displays the final value  
- Clean structure with separate files (App.js, Box.js, SmallBox.js, styles.css)

## 🧠 What You Learn
- How props work in React  
- How components receive data in the function signature  
- How to pass props forward using JSX  
- How one-way data flow keeps components predictable and simple
